# Camera-Based-Vehicle-Identification-System
This project is mainly focused on developing a Mobile Application which is used to identify the vehicles that has violated any of the Traffic rules, by capturing the vehicle images through camera. These captured images are then processed using OCR technology to identify the number plate and retrieve the characters from the number plate. Based on the number plate details, the registration details of the vehicle will be retrieved and a challan will be generated which includes the details of the vehicle along with the fine and the rule that is being violated. Then the challan details will be sent to the registered mobile number of the vehicleâ€™s owner for them to pay the fine amount.
